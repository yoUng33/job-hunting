# 158. Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times
<https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4-ii-call-multiple-times/>
Medium

Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method read to read n characters. Your method read may be called multiple times.

**Method read4:**

The API read4 reads four consecutive characters from file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf4.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.

**Definition of read4:**

    Parameter:  char[] buf4
    Returns:    int

buf4[] is a destination, not a source. The results from read4 will be copied to buf4[].
Below is a high-level example of how read4 works:
    ![alt text](../resources/158_q1.png)

File file("abcde"); // File is "abcde", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
char[] buf4 = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 4. Now buf4 = "abcd", fp points to 'e'
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 1. Now buf4 = "e", fp points to end of file
read4(buf4); // read4 returns 0. Now buf4 = "", fp points to end of file
 

**Method read:**

By using the read4 method, implement the method read that reads n characters from file and store it in the buffer array buf. Consider that you cannot manipulate file directly.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

**Definition of read:**

    Parameters:	char[] buf, int n
    Returns:	int

buf[] is a destination, not a source. You will need to write the results to buf[].

**Note:**

Consider that you cannot manipulate the file directly. The file is only accessible for read4 but not for read.
The read function may be called multiple times.
Please remember to RESET your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are persisted across multiple test cases. Please see here for more details.
You may assume the destination buffer array, buf, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing n characters.
It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer buf is called by read.
 

**Example 1:**

Input: file = "abc", queries = [1,2,1]
Output: [1,2,0]
Explanation: The test case represents the following scenario:
File file("abc");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "a". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.
sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain "bc". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.

**Example 2:**

Input: file = "abc", queries = [4,1]
Output: [3,0]
Explanation: The test case represents the following scenario:
File file("abc");
Solution sol;
sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain "abc". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.
sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.
 

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= file.length <= 500
* file consist of English letters and digits.
* 1 <= queries.length <= 10
* 1 <= queries[i] <= 500

## Explanation: 
这道题是之前那道 Read N Characters Given Read4 的拓展，那道题说 read 函数只能调用一次，而这道题说 read 函数可以调用多次，那么难度就增加了，为了更简单直观的说明问题，举个简单的例子吧，比如：
    buf = "ab", [read(1),read(2)]，返回 ["a","b"]
那么第一次调用 read(1) 后，从 buf 中读出一个字符，就是第一个字符a，然后又调用了一个 read(2)，想取出两个字符，但是 buf 中只剩一个b了，所以就把取出的结果就是b。再来看一个例子：
    buf = "a", [read(0),read(1),read(2)]，返回 ["","a",""]
第一次调用 read(0)，不取任何字符，返回空，第二次调用 read(1)，取一个字符，buf 中只有一个字符，取出为a，然后再调用 read(2)，想取出两个字符，但是 buf 中没有字符了，所以取出为空。


## Solution:
用char[] buff 和 buffCnt 记录 read4() 返回的结果和结果个数。buffPtr 记录当前在 buff 中的位置。用 ptr 记录写入buf 中的个数。在循环中，如果 buffPtr 为0，调用 read4()。然后把读取的buff一个个放入buf。如果 buffPtr >= buffCnt, 说明当前结果已经读完，重置 buffPtr，让下个循环调用 read4()。

```java
/**
 * The read4 API is defined in the parent class Reader4.
 *     int read4(char[] buf4); 
 */

public class Solution extends Reader4 {
    /**
     * @param buf Destination buffer
     * @param n   Number of characters to read
     * @return    The number of actual characters read
     */
    private int buffPtr = 0;
    private int buffCnt = 0;
    private char[] buff = new char[4];
    public int read(char[] buf, int n) {
        int ptr = 0;
        while(ptr < n){
            if(buffPtr == 0){
                buffCnt = read4(buff);
            }
            if(buffCnt == 0) break;
            while (ptr < n && buffPtr < buffCnt) {
                buf[ptr++] = buff[buffPtr++];
            }
            if (buffPtr >= buffCnt) buffPtr = 0;
        }
        return ptr;
    }
}
```
