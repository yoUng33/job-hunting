Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.

**Example 1:**

    Input: ["abcd","dcba","lls","s","sssll"]
    Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,2],[2,4]] 
    Explanation: The palindromes are ["dcbaabcd","abcddcba","slls","llssssll"]
