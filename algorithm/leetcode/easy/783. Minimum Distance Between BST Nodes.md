# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes
<https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/>
Easy

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node root, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

**Example :**

    Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
    Output: 1
    Explanation:
    Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

    The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

              4
            /   \
           2     6
          / \    
         1   3  

    while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.

**Note:**

    1. The size of the BST will be between 2 and 100.
    2. The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.

### Inorder Traversal Recursion Solution: 
因为BST inorder遍历是排序的，所有用pre记录上一个值，然后差值是root.val - pre, 和结果对比并更新。
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE, pre = -1;
    public int minDiffInBST(TreeNode root) {
        if(root == null) return 0;
        minDiffInBST(root.left);
        if(pre != -1) res = Math.min(res, root.val-pre);
        pre = root.val;
        minDiffInBST(root.right);
        return res;
    }
}
```
