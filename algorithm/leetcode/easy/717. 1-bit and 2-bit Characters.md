# 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
<https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters/>
Easy

We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit 0. The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

**Example 1:**
    Input: 
    bits = [1, 0, 0]
    Output: True
    Explanation: 
    The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
**Example 2:**
    Input: 
    bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
    Output: False
    Explanation: 
    The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.


Note:
    * 1 <= len(bits) <= 1000.
    * bits[i] is always 0 or 1.

### Greedy Solution:
因为两位字符只能是11和10，单位字符只能是0，所以两种字符互不影响。如果遇到1则只能是两位字符，0只能是1位字符。遍历字符，用变量i记录遍历位置，如果遇到0自加1，1自加2。如果最后能正好停在 bits.length-1上，则返回true。
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isOneBitCharacter(int[] bits) {
        int i = 0;
        while(i<bits.length-1){
            if(bits[i] == 0) i++;
            else i+=2;
        }
        return i==bits.length-1;
    }
}
```
