# 344. Reverse String
<https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/>
Easy

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.


Example 1:

    Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
    Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

    Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
    Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

## Two Pointer Solution:
用两个指针从头尾开始，同时交换两边字符。
```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int lo = 0, hi = s.length-1;
        while(lo < hi){
            char temp = s[hi];
            s[hi--] = s[lo];
            s[lo++] = temp;
        }
    }
}
```
