# 443. String Compression
<https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/>
Easy

Given an array of characters, compress it in-place.
The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.
Every element of the array should be a character (not int) of length 1.
After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

Could you solve it using only O(1) extra space?

**Example 1:**

    Input:
    ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

    Output:
    Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

    Explanation:
    "aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
    

**Example 2:**

    Input:
    ["a"]

    Output:
    Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

    Explanation:
    Nothing is replaced.
    

**Example 3:**

    Input:
    ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]

    Output:
    Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"].

    Explanation:
    Since the character "a" does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbbbbbbbbbbb" is replaced by "b12".
    Notice each digit has it's own entry in the array.

### Solution:
用 Two Pointer, 其中一个指针 idxAns 指向要修改的位置，然后另一个指针 idx 向后遍历并计数。用变量 currentChar 记录重复的字符。然后idx循环遍历，直到找到不同的字符。然后处理遍历过的重复字符，idxAns赋值当前的重复字符。如果计数大与1， 那就要插入计数。当个数是两位数的时候，比如12，这里是将12拆分成1和2，然后存入数组的。那么比较简便的是把计数转换成string开始遍历。最后长度为idxAns。

```java
class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int idx = 0, idxAns = 0;
        while(idx < chars.length){
            char currentChar = chars[idx];
            int count = 0;
            while(idx < chars.length && chars[idx] == currentChar){
                idx++;
                count++;
            }
            chars[idxAns++] = currentChar;
            if(count != 1)
                for(char c : Integer.toString(count).toCharArray()) 
                    chars[idxAns++] = c;
        }
        return idxAns;
    }
}
```
