# 849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person
<https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-distance-to-closest-person/>
Easy

In a row of seats, 1 represents a person sitting in that seat, and 0 represents that the seat is empty. 

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return that maximum distance to closest person.

**Example 1:**

    Input: [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
    Output: 2
    Explanation:  
    If Alex sits in the second open seat (seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
    If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
    Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.


**Example 2:**

    Input: [1,0,0,0]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    If Alex sits in the last seat, the closest person is 3 seats away.
    This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.


**Note:**

1 <= seats.length <= 20000
seats contains only 0s or 1s, at least one 0, and at least one 1.

### Two Pointers Solution: 
在遍历的过程中统计出连续空位的个数，即连续0的个数。用双指针，prev 指向上一个1的位置，i为当前遍历到的位置。当遇到1的时候，此时先判断下 prev 的值，若是-1的话，表明当前这段连续的空位是靠着墙的，所以要用连续空位的长度 i 来直接更新结果 res, 否则的话就是两头有人的中间的空位，那么用长度除以2: (i - prev)/2 来更新结果 res，此时 prev 要更新为 i. for 循环退出后，还是要处理最右边靠墙的位置，用 seats.length-prev-1 来更新结果 res 即可。


```java
class Solution {
    public int maxDistToClosest(int[] seats) {
        int res = 0, prev = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i<seats.length; i++){
            if(seats[i] == 1){
                res = prev == -1? i:Math.max(res, (i-prev)/2);
                prev = i;
            }
        }
        res = Math.max(res, seats.length-prev-1);
        return res;
    }
}
```
