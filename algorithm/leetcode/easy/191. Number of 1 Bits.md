# 191. Number of 1 Bits
<https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/>
Easy

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

Example 1:

    Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
Example 2:

    Input: 00000000000000000000000010000000
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
Example 3:

    Input: 11111111111111111111111111111101
    Output: 31
    Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
 

Note:

* Note that in some languages such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as signed integer type and should not affect your implementation, as the internal binary representation of the integer is the same whether it is signed or unsigned.
* In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using 2's complement notation. Therefore, in Example 3 above the input represents the signed integer -3.

## Solution:
Bit shifting. 每次循环，通过 n&1 计算n末位并加入结果。然后n右移1位。如果n为0，结束循环。
Java中，我们在while条件中只能用 n!=0, 不能用n>0。。要注意Integer.MAX_VALUE = 2147483647。Java int type是有符号的。所以Integer.MAX_VALUE+1 == Integer.MIN_VALUE。如果输入是2147483648， 则会变成-2147483648，如果条件是n>0, 那永远不会进入循环。
```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int ones = 0;
        while(n!=0) {
            ones += (n & 1);
            n = n>>>1;
        }
        return ones;
    }
}
```
