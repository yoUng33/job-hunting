# 674. Longest Continuous Increasing Subsequence
<https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-continuous-increasing-subsequence/>
Easy

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).

**Example 1:**
    Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3. 
    Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4. 

**Example 2:**
    Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1. 

**Note:** Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.

### Solution:
用变量 start 标记当前递增序列的开始位。从第二位开始遍历数组，如果当前数值比前一位小，则当前递增序列中断。所以当前序列长度 i-start 和 当前最长max对比更新，并重置 start 为当前索引。最后还需要更新一次max，再返回。

```java
class Solution {
    public int findLengthOfLCIS(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        int max = 1, start = 0, i = 1;
        for(; i<nums.length; i++){
            if(nums[i-1]>=nums[i]){
                max = Math.max(i-start, max);
                start = i;
            }
        }
        return max = Math.max(i-start, max);
    }
}
```
