# 860. Lemonade Change
<https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/>
Easy

At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5. 

Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).

Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.

Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.

Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.


**Example 1:**

    Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
    Output: true
    Explanation: 
    From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
    From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
    From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
    Since all customers got correct change, we output true.

**Example 2:**

    Input: [5,5,10]
    Output: true

**Example 3:**

    Input: [10,10]
    Output: false

**Example 4:**

    Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
    Output: false
    Explanation: 
    From the first two customers in order, we collect two $5 bills.
    For the next two customers in order, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
    For the last customer, we can't give change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
    Since not every customer received correct change, the answer is false.
 

**Note:**

* 0 <= bills.length <= 10000
* bills[i] will be either 5, 10, or 20.

### Map Solution
用map来统计当前钞票的个数。这里用array来替代。
* 当收到$5时，不用找钱，$5的个数自增。
* 当收到$10时，需要付出一张$5，所以$5自减，$10自增。
* 当收到$20时，优先付出一张$10和$5，因为$5是最基础的钱，使用最多。如果没有$10, 就付出3张$5。
每次找完钱，检查$5是否为负。是的话返回false。循环完返回true。这里能看出只需要统计$5和$10就可以。

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int[] money = new int[2];
        for(int b : bills){
            if(b == 5) money[0]++;
            else if(b == 10) { money[0]--; money[1]++;}
            else if(b == 20) {
                if(money[1]>0) { money[0]--; money[1]--;}
                else money[0]-=3;
            }
            if(money[0]<0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```
