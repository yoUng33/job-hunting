# 278. First Bad Version
<https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version/>
Easy

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

Example:

    Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

    call isBadVersion(3) -> false
    call isBadVersion(5) -> true
    call isBadVersion(4) -> true

    Then 4 is the first bad version.

## Binary Search Solution:
好版本和坏版本一定有个边界，那么我们用二分法来找这个边界，对mid值调用API函数，如果是坏版本，说明边界在左边，则把mid赋值给right，如果是好版本，则说明边界在右边，则把mid+1赋给left，最后返回left即可。
注意算mid最好是int mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2，防止溢出。
```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int lo = 1, hi = n;
        while(lo < hi){
            int mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
            if(isBadVersion(mid)){
                hi = mid;
            }else{
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return lo;
    }
}
```
