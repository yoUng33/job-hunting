# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
<https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/>
Easy

Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

For example, the following two linked lists:
![alt text](./../resources/160_statement.png)
    begin to intersect at node c1.

 

Example 1:
![alt text](../resources/160_example_1.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,0,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
    Output: Reference of the node with value = 8
    Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,0,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
 

Example 2:

![alt text](../resources/160_example_2.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [0,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
    Output: Reference of the node with value = 2
    Input Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect). From the head of A, it reads as [0,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.


Example 3:

![alt text](../resources/160_example_3.png)

    Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
    Output: null
    Input Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
    Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
 

Notes:

* If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
* The linked lists must retain their original structure after the function returns.
* You may assume there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.
* Your code should preferably run in O(n) time and use only O(1) memory.

## Circle Solution:
用环的思想来做，我们让两条链表分别从各自的开头开始往后遍历，当其中一条遍历到末尾时，我们跳到另一个条链表的开头继续遍历。两个指针最终会相等，而且只有两种情况，一种情况是在交点处相遇，另一种情况是在各自的末尾的空节点处相等。为什么一定会相等呢，因为两个指针走过的路程相同，是两个链表的长度之和，所以一定会相等。
```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode(int x) {
 *         val = x;
 *         next = null;
 *     }
 * }

public class Solution {
    public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
        if(headA == null || headB== null) return null;
        ListNode a = headA;
        ListNode b = headB;
        while(a != b){
            a = a == null?headB:a.next;
            b = b == null?headA:b.next;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
