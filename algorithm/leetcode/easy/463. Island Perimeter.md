# 463. Island Perimeter
<https://leetcode.com/problems/island-perimeter/>
Easy

You are given a map in form of a two-dimensional integer grid where 1 represents land and 0 represents water.

Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).

The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.

Input:
    [[0,1,0,0],
    [1,1,1,0],
    [0,1,0,0],
    [1,1,0,0]]

    Output: 16

    Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image below:

### Solution:
从左上角遍历整个数组，用变量 island 统计island个数，然后检查左边和下边相邻的格子是否有岛屿，用变量 neigh 统计。最后island 乘以4条边减去neigh重复的2条边就是结果。因为只计算一个方向的所以不会重复统计neigh。

```java
class Solution {
    public int islandPerimeter(int[][] grid) {
        int island = 0, neigh = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i<grid.length; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<grid[0].length; j++){
                if(grid[i][j] == 1){
                    island++;
                    if(i<grid.length-1 && grid[i+1][j] == 1) neigh++;
                    if(j<grid[0].length-1 && grid[i][j+1] == 1) neigh++;
                }
            }
        }
        return island*4 - 2*neigh;
    }
}
```
