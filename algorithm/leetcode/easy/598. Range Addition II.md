# 598. Range Addition II
<https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii/>
Easy

Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

**Example 1:**
    Input: 
    m = 3, n = 3
    operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: 
    Initially, M = 
    [[0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]]

    After performing [2,2], M = 
    [[1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]]

    After performing [3,3], M = 
    [[2, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 1],
    [1, 1, 1]]

    So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

**Note:**
1. The range of m and n is [1,40000].
2. The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
3. The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.

### Solution
因为是取最大数的个数，而最大数等于ops中重复最多的，即出现过坐标最小的。所以用minI 和 minJ 记录ops中的最小坐标。最后返回 minI*minJ 就是出现次数。

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        int minI = m, minJ = n;
        for(int[] op : ops){
            minI = Math.min(op[0], minI);
            minJ = Math.min(op[1], minJ);
        }
        return minI*minJ;
    }
}
```
