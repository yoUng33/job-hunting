# 441. Arranging Coins
<https://leetcode.com/problems/arranging-coins/>
Easy

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

    n = 5

    The coins can form the following rows:
    ¤
    ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤

    Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

    n = 8

    The coins can form the following rows:
    ¤
    ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤ ¤
    ¤ ¤

    Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

### Binary Search Solution:
二分搜索法，我们搜索前i行之和刚好大于n的临界点，这样我们减一个就是能排满的行数.

Time: O(logN)
```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        if(n<=1) return n;
        int lo = 1, hi = n;
        while(lo<hi){
            int mid = lo+(hi-lo)/2;
            if(0.5*mid*mid + 0.5*mid <= n) lo = mid+1;
            else hi = mid;
        }
        return lo-1;
    }
}
```


### Math Solution:
[The mathematic approach]<https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/65593/java-clean-code-with-explanations-and-running-time-2-solutions/2>
充分利用了等差数列的性质，我们建立等式, n = (1 + x) * x / 2, 我们用一元二次方程的求根公式可以得到 x = (-1 + sqrt(8 * n + 1)) / 2, 然后取整后就是能填满的行数.
```java
class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        return (int) ((Math.sqrt(1 + 8.0 * n) - 1) / 2);
    }
}
```
