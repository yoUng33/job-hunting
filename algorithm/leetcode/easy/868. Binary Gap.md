# 868. Binary Gap

Easy

Given a positive integer N, find and return the longest distance between two consecutive 1's in the binary representation of N.

If there aren't two consecutive 1's, return 0.


Example 1:

    Input: 22
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 
    22 in binary is 0b10110.
    In the binary representation of 22, there are three ones, and two consecutive pairs of 1's.
    The first consecutive pair of 1's have distance 2.
    The second consecutive pair of 1's have distance 1.
    The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.

Example 2:

    Input: 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: 
    5 in binary is 0b101.

Example 3:

    Input: 6
    Output: 1
    Explanation: 
    6 in binary is 0b110.

Example 4:

    Input: 8
    Output: 0
    Explanation: 
    8 in binary is 0b1000.
    There aren't any consecutive pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.

Note:
    * 1 <= N <= 10^9

### Solution
从右向左按位取数，因为整型数只有 32 位，所以能循环32遍可以取到所有位。用变量 last 来记录上一个1的位置，初始为-1表示没有。对当前位直接与'1'来判断是否为'1'，如果last大于等于零，则距离为 i - last，更新res。然后更新last为i。

```java
class Solution {
    public int binaryGap(int N) {
        int res = 0, last = -1;
        for(int i = 0; i<32; i++){
            if( ((N>>i)&1) != 0){
                if(last >=0) res = Math.max(res, i-last);
                last = i;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
