Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of three.

Example 1:

    Input: 27
    Output: true
Example 2:

    Input: 0
    Output: false
Example 3:

    Input: 9
    Output: true
Example 4:

    Input: 45
    Output: false

## Iteration Solution:
注意n = 1的情况。
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        while(n%3 == 0 && n>1) n /= 3;
        return n==1;
    }
}
```

## Divide by largest power of 3 Solution
由于输入是int，正数范围是0-231，在此范围中允许的最大的3的次方数为319=1162261467，那么我们只要看这个数能否被n整除即可。
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return ( n>0 &&  1162261467%n==0);     // 1162261467 is 3^19,  3^20 is bigger than int  
    }
}
```

## Log Solution
If log10(n) / log10(3) returns an int (more precisely, a double but has 0 after decimal point), then n is a power of 3. (original post). But be careful here, you cannot use log (natural log) here, because it will generate round off error for n=243. This is more like a coincidence. I mean when n=243, we have the following results:

log(243) = 5.493061443340548    log(3) = 1.0986122886681098
   ==> log(243)/log(3) = 4.999999999999999

log10(243) = 2.385606273598312    log10(3) = 0.47712125471966244
   ==> log10(243)/log10(3) = 5.0
This happens because log(3) is actually slightly larger than its true value due to round off, which makes the ratio smaller.
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return (Math.log10(n) / Math.log10(3)) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
```
