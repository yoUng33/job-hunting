# 506. Relative Ranks
<https://leetcode.com/problems/relative-ranks/>
Easy

Given scores of N athletes, find their relative ranks and the people with the top three highest scores, who will be awarded medals: "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal".

**Example 1:**
    Input: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    Output: ["Gold Medal", "Silver Medal", "Bronze Medal", "4", "5"]
    Explanation: The first three athletes got the top three highest scores, so they got "Gold Medal", "Silver Medal" and "Bronze Medal". 
    For the left two athletes, you just need to output their relative ranks according to their scores.
Note:  
1. N is a positive integer and won't exceed 10,000.
2. All the scores of athletes are guaranteed to be unique.


### Solution:
用一个map来保存nums中nums[i]对应的i。这里用一个二维数组track。然后对数组track中的nums[i]按大小排序。最后遍历track并填充输出，对于track数组中的前三个，要输出相应的字符串。
```java
class Solution {
    public String[] findRelativeRanks(int[] nums) {
        int[][] track = new int[nums.length][2];
        for(int i = 0; i<nums.length; i++){
            track[i][0] = nums[i];
            track[i][1] = i;
        }
        Arrays.sort(track, (a,b)->(b[0]-a[0]));
        
        String[] res = new String[nums.length];
        for(int i = 0; i<track.length; i++){
            if(i == 0) res[track[i][1]] = "Gold Medal";
            else if(i == 1) res[track[i][1]] = "Silver Medal";
            else if(i == 2) res[track[i][1]] = "Bronze Medal";
            else res[track[i][1]] = String.valueOf(i+1);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
