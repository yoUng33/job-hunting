# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
<https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower/>
Easy

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.
You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):

    -1 : My number is lower
    1 : My number is higher
    0 : Congrats! You got it!
Example :

    Input: n = 10, pick = 6
    Output: 6

## Solution:
用binary search，如果guess返回值为1，lo = mid+1。否则 hi = mid-1。最后没找到，返回-1。
```java
/* The guess API is defined in the parent class GuessGame.
   @param num, your guess
   @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
      int guess(int num); */

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int lo = 1, hi = n;
        while(lo<=hi){
            int mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
            int guessRes = guess(mid);
            if(guessRes == 0){
                return mid;
            }else if(guessRes > 0){
                lo = mid+1;
            }else{
                hi = mid-1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```
