# 575. Distribute Candies
<https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-candies/>
Easy

Given an integer array with even length, where different numbers in this array represent different kinds of candies. Each number means one candy of the corresponding kind. You need to distribute these candies equally in number to brother and sister. Return the maximum number of kinds of candies the sister could gain.

**Example 1:**
    Input: candies = [1,1,2,2,3,3]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    There are three different kinds of candies (1, 2 and 3), and two candies for each kind.
    Optimal distribution: The sister has candies [1,2,3] and the brother has candies [1,2,3], too. 
    The sister has three different kinds of candies. 

**Example 2:**
    Input: candies = [1,1,2,3]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: For example, the sister has candies [2,3] and the brother has candies [1,1]. 
    The sister has two different kinds of candies, the brother has only one kind of candies. 

**Note:**
    1. The length of the given array is in range [2, 10,000], and will be even.
    2. The number in given array is in range [-100,000, 100,000].

### Solution:
因为平均分配，所以每个人最多拿到 n/2 块糖。那么能拿到的最大的糖的种类数也就是n／2种，不可能再多，只可能再少。那么我们要做的就是统计出总共的糖的种类数，如果糖的种类数小于n/2，说明拿不到n/2种糖，最多能拿到的种类数数就是当前糖的总种类数。根据这个理论，用set的自动去重来求糖的种类，然后和 n/2 比较，取较小的值返回。
```java
class Solution {
    public int distributeCandies(int[] candies) {
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet();
        for(int candie : candies){
            set.add(candie);
        }
        return Math.min(candies.length/2, set.size());
    }
}
```
