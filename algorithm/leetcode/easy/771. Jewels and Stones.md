# 771. Jewels and Stones
<https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/>
Easy

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

**Example 1:**

    Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
    Output: 3

**Example 2:**

    Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
    Output: 0

**Note:**

    * S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
    * The characters in J are distinct.

### HashSet Solution: 
用set jSet保存J中所有的字符。然后遍历S中的字符，如果jSet有，则sum++。最后返回sum。
```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        Set<Character> jSet = new HashSet();
        int sum = 0;
        for(char c : J.toCharArray()){
            jSet.add(c);
        }
        for(char c : S.toCharArray()){
            if(jSet.contains(c)) sum++;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Oneline replace Solution: 
用regex来把S中所有非J的字符替换成空字符。最后S的长度就是结果。

```java
class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String J, String S) {
        return S.replaceAll("[^" + J + "]", "").length();
    }
}
```
