# 566. Reshape the Matrix
<https://leetcode.com/problems/reshape-the-matrix/>
Easy

In MATLAB, there is a very useful function called 'reshape', which can reshape a matrix into a new one with different size but keep its original data.

You're given a matrix represented by a two-dimensional array, and two positive integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix, respectively.

The reshaped matrix need to be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the 'reshape' operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

**Example 1:**
    Input: 
    nums = 
    [[1,2],
    [3,4]]
    r = 1, c = 4
    Output: 
    [[1,2,3,4]]
    Explanation:
    The row-traversing of nums is [1,2,3,4]. The new reshaped matrix is a 1 * 4 matrix, fill it row by row by using the previous list.

**Example 2:**
    Input: 
    nums = 
    [[1,2],
    [3,4]]
    r = 2, c = 4
    Output: 
    [[1,2],
    [3,4]]
    Explanation:
    There is no way to reshape a 2 * 2 matrix to a 2 * 4 matrix. So output the original matrix.

Note:
1. The height and width of the given matrix is in range [1, 100].
2. The given r and c are all positive.

### Two For Loops Solution:
先判断新数组的大小是否和旧的一致。位置转换的方法是先把nums 拉成直线，获得当前数在 nums 中是第几个数。然后获得新数组中对应的位置：res[k/c][k%c]。
```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {
        int m = nums.length, n = nums[0].length;
        if(r*c != m*n) return nums;
        int[][] res = new int[r][c];
        for(int i = 0; i<m; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<n; j++){
                int k = i*n + j;
                res[k/c][k%c] = nums[i][j];
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

### One for Loop Solution:
在 Two for loop 上更进一步，把 nums 和 res 都拉成直线。再分别转换成对应的二维数组：res[i/c][i%c] = nums[i/n][i%n]。

```java
class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] nums, int r, int c) {
        int m = nums.length, n = nums[0].length;
        if(r*c != m*n) return nums;
        
        int[][] res = new int[r][c];
        
        for(int i = 0; i<r*c; i++){
            res[i/c][i%c] = nums[i/n][i%n];
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
