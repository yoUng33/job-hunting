# 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III
<https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree-iii/>
Medium

Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:

    class Node {
        public int val;
        public Node left;
        public Node right;
        public Node parent;
    }

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)."

Example 1:
![alt text](../resources/1650_q1.png)

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

Example 3:
Input: root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2
Output: 1
 

**Constraints:**
    * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
    * -109 <= Node.val <= 109
    * All Node.val are unique.
    * p != q
    * p and q exist in the tree.

## Explanation:
这道求二叉树的最小共同父节点的题是之前那道 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree 的 Follow Up。和之前不同的是这个Node有parent node 的链接。

## Two trackers Solution:
用两个指针 a，b，分别从 p，q往上找。如果 a != b，循环遍历 parent node。如果 p 和 q 在同一个分支上，则能找到。如果不在同一个分支上，则把指针连到另个起点形成环。这样就能找到交汇点。

Time: O(h1+h2), h1, h2-heights of two nodes.
Space: O(1)

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
};
*/

class Solution {
    public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node p, Node q) {
        Node a = p, b = q;
        while(a != b){
            a = a == null? q : a.parent;
            b = b == null? p : b.parent;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```


## Set Solution: 
用一个 set seen 来保存 p 和 q 的 parent。如果 set 中有相同的 node，则直接返回。

Time: O(h)
Space: O(h)

```java
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
};
*/

class Solution {
    public Node lowestCommonAncestor(Node p, Node q) {
        Set<Node> seen = new HashSet<>();
        while(p != null) {
            seen.add(p);
            p = p.parent;
        }
        
        while(q != null) {
            if (seen.contains(q)) {
                return q;
            }
            q = q.parent;
        }
        
        return null;
    }
}
```
