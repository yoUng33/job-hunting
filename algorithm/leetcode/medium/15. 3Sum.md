Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example:**

    Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

    A solution set is:
    [
    [-1, 0, 1],
    [-1, -1, 2]
    ]
