<https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-preorder-traversal/>
Medium

Given a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:

    Input: [1,null,2,3]
       1
        \
        2
        /
       3

Output: [1,2,3]
Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
