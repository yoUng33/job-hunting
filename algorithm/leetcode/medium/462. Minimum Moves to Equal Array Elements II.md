# 462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II
<https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-equal-array-elements-ii/>
Medium

Given a non-empty integer array, find the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.

You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.

**Example:**

    Input:
    [1,2,3]

    Output:
    2

    Explanation:
    Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):

    [1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
