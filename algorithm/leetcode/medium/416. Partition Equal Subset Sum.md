Medium

Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

**Note:**

    1. Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
    2. The array size will not exceed 200.
 
**Example 1:**

    Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

    Output: true

    Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
 

**Example 2:**

    Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

    Output: false

    Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
