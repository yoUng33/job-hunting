# 307. Range Sum Query - Mutable
<https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-mutable/>
Medium

Given an integer array nums, find the sum of the elements between indices i and j (i â‰¤ j), inclusive.

The update(i, val) function modifies nums by updating the element at index i to val.

**Example:**

    Given nums = [1, 3, 5]

    sumRange(0, 2) -> 9
    update(1, 2)
    sumRange(0, 2) -> 8

**Note:**

    1. The array is only modifiable by the update function.
    2. You may assume the number of calls to update and sumRange function is distributed evenly.
