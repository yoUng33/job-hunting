Medium

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.

Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.

**Example 1:**

    Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
    (time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
    (time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
    (time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60

**Example 2:**

    Input: time = [60,60,60]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.

## Explanation:
要 (a+b)%60 == 0, 有两种情况：
1. (a+b)%60 == 0
2. ((a%60 + b%60))%60 == 0
所以对输入值%60， 就和 [1. Two Sum](../easy/1.%20Two%20Sum.md)一样了。

## RemainderMap Array Solution:
因为是余60，所以用一个int[60]的array remaindermap 作为map来保存余数出现的次数。遍历数组，每次循环检查  (a+b)%60 == 0 和 ((a%60 + b%60))%60 == 0 的情况，加上 remaindermap 中对应余数出现的次数。然后remaindermap[t%60]自增。最后返回统计结果 count。

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int[] remaindermap = new int[60];
        int count = 0;
        for(int t : time){
            if(t%60 == 0){
                count += remaindermap[0];
            }else{
                count += remaindermap[60-t%60];
            }
            remaindermap[t%60]++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
