# 1487. Making File Names Unique
<https://leetcode.com/problems/making-file-names-unique/>
Medium

Given an array of strings names of size n. You will create n folders in your file system such that, at the ith minute, you will create a folder with the name names[i].

Since two files cannot have the same name, if you enter a folder name that was previously used, the system will have a suffix addition to its name in the form of (k), where, k is the smallest positive integer such that the obtained name remains unique.

Return an array of strings of length n where ans[i] is the actual name the system will assign to the ith folder when you create it.

**Example 1:**

Input: names = ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes","fifa","gta","pes(2019)"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"pes" --> not assigned before, remains "pes"
"fifa" --> not assigned before, remains "fifa"
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"pes(2019)" --> not assigned before, remains "pes(2019)"

**Example 2:**

Input: names = ["gta","gta(1)","gta","avalon"]
Output: ["gta","gta(1)","gta(2)","avalon"]
Explanation: Let's see how the file system creates folder names:
"gta" --> not assigned before, remains "gta"
"gta(1)" --> not assigned before, remains "gta(1)"
"gta" --> the name is reserved, system adds (k), since "gta(1)" is also reserved, systems put k = 2. it becomes "gta(2)"
"avalon" --> not assigned before, remains "avalon"

**Example 3:**

Input: names = ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece"]
Output: ["onepiece","onepiece(1)","onepiece(2)","onepiece(3)","onepiece(4)"]
Explanation: When the last folder is created, the smallest positive valid k is 4, and it becomes "onepiece(4)".
 

**Constraints:**
    * 1 <= names.length <= 5 * 104
    * 1 <= names[i].length <= 20
    * names[i] consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and/or round brackets.

## Explanation:
给一组字符串 names，要求给其中重复的字符串加上重复的次数。

## Map Solution: 
用 map 记录出现的 name 和最小的特殊数字。然后遍历 names，如果 map 中有对应的name。取出对应的最小的特殊数字组成新名字，在 map 中查找。如果有，继续组成新的名字并查找直到没有。最后更新map，把新名字和name对应的新最小特殊数字存入 map。


```java
class Solution {
    public String[] getFolderNames(String[] names) {
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        String[] res = new String[names.length];
        for(int i = 0; i<names.length; i++){
            if(map.containsKey(names[i])){
                int k = map.get(names[i]);
                StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(names[i]).append('(').append(k).append(')');
                while(map.containsKey(sb.toString())){
                    k++;
                    sb = new StringBuilder(names[i]).append('(').append(k).append(')');
                }
                res[i] = sb.toString();
                map.put(sb.toString(), 1);
                map.put(names[i], k+1);
            }else{
                res[i] = names[i];
                map.put(names[i], 1);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
