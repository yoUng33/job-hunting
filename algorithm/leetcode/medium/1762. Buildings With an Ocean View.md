# 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View
<https://leetcode.com/problems/buildings-with-an-ocean-view/>
Medium

There are n buildings in a line. You are given an integer array heights of size n that represents the heights of the buildings in the line.

The ocean is to the right of the buildings. A building has an ocean view if the building can see the ocean without obstructions. Formally, a building has an ocean view if all the buildings to its right have a smaller height.

Return a list of indices (0-indexed) of buildings that have an ocean view, sorted in increasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: heights = [4,2,3,1]
Output: [0,2,3]
Explanation: Building 1 (0-indexed) does not have an ocean view because building 2 is taller.
Example 2:

Input: heights = [4,3,2,1]
Output: [0,1,2,3]
Explanation: All the buildings have an ocean view.
Example 3:

Input: heights = [1,3,2,4]
Output: [3]
Explanation: Only building 3 has an ocean view.
 

**Constraints:**

    * 1 <= heights.length <= 105
    * 1 <= heights[i] <= 109

## Explanation: 
要求找到所有能看到海的房子的index。只要房子右边没有比它高的房子，就能看到海。

## Monotonic Stack Space Optimization Solution:
用一个currMax来记录当前为止右边最高的楼。从右向左遍历输入数组 heights。如果当前 height 高于 currMax,则把当前 height 加入结果并更新 currMax。最后把结果反过来输出。

Time: O(N)
Space: O(1)

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] findBuildings(int[] heights) {
        int currMax = 0;
        List<Integer> resList = new ArrayList();
        for(int i = heights.length-1; i>=0; i--){
            if(heights[i] > currMax){
                resList.add(i);
                currMax = heights[i];
            }
        }
        int[] resArr = new int[resList.size()];
        for(int i = resList.size()-1; i>=0; i--){
            resArr[resList.size()-1-i] = resList.get(i);
        }
        return resArr;
    }
}
