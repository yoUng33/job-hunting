# 497. Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles
<https://leetcode.com/problems/random-point-in-non-overlapping-rectangles/>
Medium

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles rects, write a function pick which randomly and uniformily picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

**Note:**

    1. An integer point is a point that has integer coordinates. 
    2. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is included in the space covered by the rectangles. 
    3. ith rectangle = rects[i] = [x1,y1,x2,y2], where [x1, y1] are the integer coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and [x2, y2] are the integer coordinates of the top-right corner.
    4. length and width of each rectangle does not exceed 2000.
    5. 1 <= rects.length <= 100
    6. pick return a point as an array of integer coordinates [p_x, p_y]
    7. pick is called at most 10000 times.

**Example 1:**

    Input: 
    ["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
    [[[[1,1,5,5]]],[],[],[]]
    Output: 
    [null,[4,1],[4,1],[3,3]]

**Example 2:**

    Input: 
    ["Solution","pick","pick","pick","pick","pick"]
    [[[[-2,-2,-1,-1],[1,0,3,0]]],[],[],[],[],[]]
    Output: 
    [null,[-1,-2],[2,0],[-2,-1],[3,0],[-2,-2]]

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. Solution's constructor has one argument, the array of rectangles rects. pick has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.

## Explanation: 
这道题给了我们一些非重叠的矩形，让我们返回一个这些矩形中的一个随机的点。


## TreeMap Solution: 
用TreeMap来建立当前遍历过的矩形面积之和跟该矩形位置之间的映射。然后当我们求出所有的矩形面积之和后，我们随机生成一个值，然后在TreeMap中找到第一个大于这个值的矩形。


````java
class Solution {
    TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map;
    int[][] arrays;
    int sum;
    Random rnd= new Random();
    
    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        arrays = rects;
        map = new TreeMap<>();
        sum = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < rects.length; i++) {
            int[] rect = rects[i];
						
            // the right part means the number of points can be picked in this rectangle
            sum += (rect[2] - rect[0] + 1) * (rect[3] - rect[1] + 1);
			
            map.put(sum, i);
        }
    }
    
    public int[] pick() {
        // nextInt(sum) returns a num in [0, sum -1]. After added by 1, it becomes [1, sum]
        int c = map.ceilingKey( rnd.nextInt(sum) + 1);
        
        return pickInRect(arrays[map.get(c)]);
    }
    
    private int[] pickInRect(int[] rect) {
        int left = rect[0], right = rect[2], bot = rect[1], top = rect[3];
        
        return new int[]{left + rnd.nextInt(right - left + 1), bot + rnd.nextInt(top - bot + 1) };
    }
}
