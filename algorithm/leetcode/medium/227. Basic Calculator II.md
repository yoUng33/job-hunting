Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string contains only non-negative integers, +, -, *, / operators and empty spaces . The integer division should truncate toward zero.

**Example 1:**

    Input: "3+2*2"
    Output: 7

**Example 2:**

    Input: " 3/2 "
    Output: 1

**Example 3:**

    Input: " 3+5 / 2 "
    Output: 5

**Note:**

    * You may assume that the given expression is always valid.
    * Do not use the eval built-in library function.
