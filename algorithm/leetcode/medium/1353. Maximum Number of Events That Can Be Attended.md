# 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended
<https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-events-that-can-be-attended/>
Medium

Given an array of events where events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]. Every event i starts at startDayi and ends at endDayi.
You can attend an event i at any day d where startTimei <= d <= endTimei. Notice that you can only attend one event at any time d.
Return the maximum number of events you can attend.


**Example 1:**

Input: events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can attend all the three events.
One way to attend them all is as shown.
Attend the first event on day 1.
Attend the second event on day 2.
Attend the third event on day 3.

**Example 2:**
Input: events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]
Output: 4

**Example 3:**
Input: events = [[1,4],[4,4],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]]
Output: 4

**Example 4:**
Input: events = [[1,100000]]
Output: 1

**Example 5:**
Input: events = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[1,6],[1,7]]
Output: 7

**Constraints:**

* 1 <= events.length <= 10^5
* events[i].length == 2
* 1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^5

## Explanation: 
有一系列 events，每个 event 有起始和终止时间。求问能最多参加多少events。

## PriorityQueue Solution:
逻辑是每天添加当天开始的events，并删除已经结束的events，然后取一个还在进行中的event删除并计入结果。用一个PriorityQueue pq 来保存当前进行 events 的结束时间。然后对events按开始时间排序。因为 1 <= events.length <= 10^5，所以遍历每一天，删除 pq 中已经结束的 events。然后把当天开始的event结束日期加入 pq。然后从 pq 中取一个event参加，计入结果。

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        Arrays.sort(events, new Comparator<int[]>(){ // sort events increasing by start time
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b){
                return a[0]-b[0];
            }
        });
        int i = 0, res = 0, n = events.length;
        for (int d = 1; d <= 100000; ++d) {
            while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek() < d)  // Remove events that are already closed
                pq.poll();
            while (i < n && events[i][0] == d) // Add new events that can attend on day `d`
                pq.offer(events[i++][1]);
            if (!pq.isEmpty()) { // Use day `d` to attend to the event that closes earlier
                pq.poll();
                ++res;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
