# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
<https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/>
Medium

Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Example:

    Input: [1,null,2,3]
    1
      \
        2
      /
    3

    Output: [1,3,2]

Follow up: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
