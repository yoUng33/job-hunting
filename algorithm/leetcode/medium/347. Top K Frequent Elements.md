# 347. Top K Frequent Elements
<https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-elements/>
Medium

Given a non-empty array of integers, return the k most frequent elements.

**Example 1:**

    Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2
    Output: [1,2]

**Example 2:**

    Input: nums = [1], k = 1
    Output: [1]

**Note:**

    * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ number of unique elements.
    * Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
