# 130. Surrounded Regions
<https://leetcode.com/problems/surrounded-regions/>
Medium

Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.

A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.

**Example:**

    X X X X
    X O O X
    X X O X
    X O X X

After running your function, the board should be:

    X X X X
    X X X X
    X X X X
    X O X X

**Explanation:**

Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

## Explaination: 
这是道关于 XXOO 的题，有点像围棋，将包住的O都变成X，但不同的是边缘的O不算被包围，跟之前那道 Number of Islands 很类似，都可以用 DFS 来解。


## DFS Boundary Solution: 
从边界上的 O 开始做DFS，，然后把遇到的 O 都标记一下，这些 O 就是可以连通到边界的。然后把边界的所有的 O 都做一次 DFS ，把 DFS 过程的中的 O 标记为 "*"。最后我们只需要遍历节点，把没有标记过的 O 改成 X 就可以了。

    public void solve(char[][] board) {
        if (board.length == 0 || board[0].length == 0)
            return;
        if (board.length < 2 || board[0].length < 2)
            return;
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        //Any 'O' connected to a boundary can't be turned to 'X', so ...
        //Start from first and last column, turn 'O' to '*'.
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (board[i][0] == 'O')
                boundaryDFS(board, i, 0);
            if (board[i][n-1] == 'O')
                boundaryDFS(board, i, n-1);	
        }
        //Start from first and last row, turn '0' to '*'
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (board[0][j] == 'O')
                boundaryDFS(board, 0, j);
            if (board[m-1][j] == 'O')
                boundaryDFS(board, m-1, j);	
        }
        //post-prcessing, turn 'O' to 'X', '*' back to 'O', keep 'X' intact.
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == 'O')
                    board[i][j] = 'X';

            }
        }
    }
    //Use DFS algo to turn internal however boundary-connected 'O' to '*';

        if(i<0 || i>board.length-1 || j<0 || j>board[0].length-1) return;

        if (i > 1 && board[i-1][j] == 'O')
            boundaryDFS(board, i-1, j);
        if (i < board.length - 2 && board[i+1][j] == 'O')
            boundaryDFS(board, i+1, j);
