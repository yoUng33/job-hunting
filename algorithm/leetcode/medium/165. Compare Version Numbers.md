# 165. Compare Version Numbers

Compare two version numbers version1 and version2.
If version1 > version2 return 1; if version1 < version2 return -1;otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the . character.

The . character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.

For instance, 2.5 is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

You may assume the default revision number for each level of a version number to be 0. For example, version number 3.4 has a revision number of 3 and 4 for its first and second level revision number. Its third and fourth level revision number are both 0.

 

**Example 1:**

    Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1"
    Output: -1

**Example 2:**

    Input: version1 = "1.0.1", version2 = "1"
    Output: 1

**Example 3:**

    Input: version1 = "7.5.2.4", version2 = "7.5.3"
    Output: -1

**Example 4:**

    Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: Ignoring leading zeroes, both “01” and “001" represent the same number “1”

**Example 5:**

    Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0"
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The first version number does not have a third level revision number, which means its third level revision number is default to "0"
 

**Note:**

1. Version strings are composed of numeric strings separated by dots . and this numeric strings may have leading zeroes.
2. Version strings do not start or end with dots, and they will not be two consecutive dots.

## Solution: 
按照「点」对版本号进行切割，然后依次比较每个数字即可。用 "\\." 分隔，可以把每个字符串转成int，但是如果数字过大的话，int 是无法保存的。所以我们可以不把字符串转为数字，而是直接用字符串比较。对每个数字字符串，先去掉高位0，然后从头开始一位一位对比。

```java
class Solution {
    public int compareVersion(String version1, String version2) {
        String[] ver1Arr = version1.split("\\.");
        String[] ver2Arr = version2.split("\\.");
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while(i<ver1Arr.length || j<ver2Arr.length){
            String num1 = i<ver1Arr.length? ver1Arr[i] : "0";
            String num2 = j<ver2Arr.length? ver2Arr[j] : "0";
            int res = compare(num1, num2);
            if (res == 0) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                return res;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
    
    private int compare(String num1, String num2) {
        //将高位的 0 去掉
        num1 = removeFrontZero(num1);
        num2 = removeFrontZero(num2);
        //先根据长度进行判断
        if (num1.length() > num2.length()) {
            return 1;
        } else if (num1.length() < num2.length()) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            //长度相等的时候
            for (int i = 0; i < num1.length(); i++) {
                if (num1.charAt(i) - num2.charAt(i) > 0) {
                    return 1;
                } else if (num1.charAt(i) - num2.charAt(i) < 0) {
                    return -1;
                }
            }
            return 0;
        }
    }

    private String removeFrontZero(String num) {
        int start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); i++) {
            if (num.charAt(i) == '0') {
                start++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return num.substring(start);
    }
}
```
