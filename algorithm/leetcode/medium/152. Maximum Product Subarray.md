Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.

**Example 1:**

    Input: [2,3,-2,4]
    Output: 6
    Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.

**Example 2:**

    Input: [-2,0,-1]
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
