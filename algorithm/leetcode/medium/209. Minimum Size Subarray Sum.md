<https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-size-subarray-sum/>
Medium

Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

**Example: **

    Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
