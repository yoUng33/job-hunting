# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency
<https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/>
Medium 

Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.

**Example 1:**

    Input:
    "tree"

    Output:
    "eert"

    Explanation:
    'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
    So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.

**Example 2:**

    Input:
    "cccaaa"

    Output:
    "cccaaa"

    Explanation:
    Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
    Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.

**Example 3:**

    Input:
    "Aabb"

    Output:
    "bbAa"

    Explanation:
    "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
    Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
