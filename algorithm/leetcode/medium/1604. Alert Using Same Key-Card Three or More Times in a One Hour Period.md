LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.

You are given a list of strings keyName and keyTime where [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day.

Access times are given in the 24-hour time format "HH:MM", such as "23:51" and "09:49".

Return a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in ascending order alphabetically.

Notice that "10:00" - "11:00" is considered to be within a one-hour period, while "22:51" - "23:52" is not considered to be within a one-hour period.

 

**Example 1:**

    Input: keyName = ["daniel","daniel","daniel","luis","luis","luis","luis"], keyTime = ["10:00","10:40","11:00","09:00","11:00","13:00","15:00"]
    Output: ["daniel"]
    Explanation: "daniel" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period ("10:00","10:40", "11:00").

**Example 2:**

    Input: keyName = ["alice","alice","alice","bob","bob","bob","bob"], keyTime = ["12:01","12:00","18:00","21:00","21:20","21:30","23:00"]
    Output: ["bob"]
    Explanation: "bob" used the keycard 3 times in a one-hour period ("21:00","21:20", "21:30").


**Constraints:**

    * 1 <= keyName.length, keyTime.length <= 105
    * keyName.length == keyTime.length
    * keyTime[i] is in the format "HH:MM".
    * [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] is unique.
    * 1 <= keyName[i].length <= 10
    * keyName[i] contains only lowercase English letters.

## Explanation: 
题目给出一组用户和其使用他的门卡的时间。要求找出在1小时内用门卡三次及以上的用户列表。时间是24小时表达的String，如 21:30。这里可以把时间转换成分钟的 Integer。输出的用户要按字母排序。

## Map Solution:
用一个方法来把 String 的时间转出 Integer。把时间转出分钟，即小时x60 + 分钟。用一个Map keyTimeMap 来保存用户和其门卡时间。把输入数组存入map中。然后遍历每个用户，首先对其时间列表排序，然后检查第一个和第三个，如果超过60分钟，则把用户加入结果列表 resList。最后要对 resList 排序。

```java
class Solution {
    public List<String> alertNames(String[] keyName, String[] keyTime) {
        Map<String, List<Integer>> keyTimeMap = new HashMap<>();
        List<String> resList = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int i = 0; i<keyName.length; i++){// put user and keyTime into keyTimeMap
            keyTimeMap.putIfAbsent(keyName[i], new ArrayList<>());
            keyTimeMap.get(keyName[i]).add(getTime(keyTime[i]));
        }
        for(String key : keyTimeMap.keySet()){ // check each user
            List<Integer> timeList = keyTimeMap.get(key);
            Collections.sort(timeList); // sort keyTime list
            for(int i = 2; i<timeList.size(); i++){ 
                if(timeList.get(i) - timeList.get(i-2) <= 60){// compare 1st and 3rd to find out if they are less than 60min
                    resList.add(key);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(resList);
        return resList;
    }
    
    private int getTime(String t){ // transfer stirng to relative mins. 9:30 -> 570
        String[] tsArr = t.split(":");
        return Integer.parseInt(tsArr[0])*60 + Integer.parseInt(tsArr[1]);
    }
}
```
