# 486. Predict the Winner
<https://leetcode.com/problems/predict-the-winner/>
Medium

Given an array of scores that are non-negative integers. Player 1 picks one of the numbers from either end of the array followed by the player 2 and then player 1 and so on. Each time a player picks a number, that number will not be available for the next player. This continues until all the scores have been chosen. The player with the maximum score wins.

Given an array of scores, predict whether player 1 is the winner. You can assume each player plays to maximize his score.

**Example 1:**

    Input: [1, 5, 2]
    Output: False
    Explanation: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
    If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
    So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
    Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return False.

**Example 2:**

    Input: [1, 5, 233, 7]
    Output: True
    Explanation: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 have to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
    Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

**Note:**

    1. 1 <= length of the array <= 20.
    2. Any scores in the given array are non-negative integers and will not exceed 10,000,000.
    3. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner.

## Explanation: 
这道题给了一个小游戏，有一个数组，两个玩家轮流取数，说明了只能从开头或结尾取，问我们第一个玩家能赢吗。应该是用 Minimax 来做，之前有过一道这样的题 Guess Number Higher or Lower II。

## DP Recursive Solution: 
如果player1要赢，必须得到的比player2多。把每次选择当做增加，player2选择当做减少。用 s 和 e 来记录下个可选的头尾位置。DP 数组的作用是保存中间结果，再次遇到相同情况时直接返回不用再次计算。
递归函数中计算当前player的最佳选择。如果 e == s，只能返回唯一剩下的nums[e]。这是当前用户有两种选择：
* nums[s]-helper(nums,s+1,e): 当前用户选择头，那下个用户只能选择 s+1或者 e。
* nums[e]-helper(nums,s,e-1): 当前用户选择尾，那下个用户只能选择 s或者 e-1。
返回两种选择中的较大值。

Time: O(n^2)
Space: O(n^2)

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
        return helper(nums, 0, nums.length-1, new Integer[nums.length][nums.length])>=0;
    }
    
    private int helper(int[] nums, int s, int e, Integer[][] dp){
        if(dp[s][e] == null){
            dp[s][e] = s==e? nums[e] : Math.max(nums[e]-helper(nums,s,e-1,dp),nums[s]-helper(nums,s+1,e,dp));
        }
        return dp[s][e];
    }
}
```

## DP Minimax Solution: 

DP 加 Minimax 的迭代写法，要注意的是 DP 的更新顺序，跟以往不太一样，这种更新方法是按区间来更新的，感觉之前好像没有遇到过这种更新的方法.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean PredictTheWinner(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { dp[i][i] = nums[i]; }
        for (int len = 1; len < n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len;
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(nums[i] - dp[i + 1][j], nums[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n - 1] >= 0;
    }
}
```
