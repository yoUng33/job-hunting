Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

    Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
    Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

**Example 2:**

    Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
    Output: [[1,5]]
    Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
