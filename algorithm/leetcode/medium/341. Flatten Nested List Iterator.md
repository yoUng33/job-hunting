# 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator
<https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-nested-list-iterator/>
Medium

Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

**Example 1:**

    Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
    Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
    Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
                the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

**Example 2:**

    Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
    Output: [1,4,6]
    Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
                the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
